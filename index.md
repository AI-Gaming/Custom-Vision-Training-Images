## AI Gaming training and test images for Microsoft Custom Vision Events

There are two phases to training your Custom Vision Image Identifier.

1. Train your model with training data
2. Test your model with testing data

You should not use the testing data for training. Using test images that the Custom Vision model has not been trained on will correctly test if you Custom Vision model is sufficiently trained to recognise new images.
